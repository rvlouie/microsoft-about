    		<h1>About The Rubber Tracks Audio Library</h1>
    		<p>Converse created the Rubber Tracks studio to provide up-and-coming bands with high-quality recordings, for free. Continuing in this spirit of supporting the community, Converse is expanding the Rubber Tracks initiative to the web, by creating a massive online library of sounds recorded at Rubber Tracks. This major initiative will bring the Rubber Tracks experience to people all over the world, and will contain samples, loops, and stems from Rubber Tracks artists. The goal of the Rubber Tracks audio library is to provide a valuable free resource to independent musicians around the world, while also promoting Rubber Tracks artists and their content in a new way.</p><p>Rubber Tracks online will have two major elements: a massive audio library of sounds recorded in the studio, along with promotional artist pages which will feature the musicians who created the audio. This is a great exposure opportunity to get involved with a positive initiative that will help musicians around the world.</p><p>Rubber Tracks Online is set to launch in Spring 2014, and Converse would be excited to include elements from your session in the library. Essentially, this means that small samples and loops from the session you recorded at Rubber Tracks will be uploaded for other musicians to download and use in their creations for free. No immediately recognizable elements of your music will be included if you don’t want them to - the samples and loops will be so short that they you won’t be giving your tracks away for free.</p><p>This is a great opportunity to be part of a positive movement at the forefront of collaborative music creation, and to get exposure for your music.</p>

    		<h1>Here’s what you would need to do to be a part of Rubber Tracks Online</h1>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Agree to allow Rubber Tracks to make some audio from your Rubber Tracks recording available for others to download and use in their own creations.
    			</li>
    			<li>Decide what level of audio you are comfortable allowing people to use:
    				<ol>
    					<li>Single sounds and unrecognizable loops only, including drum loops, bass lines, etc. </li>
    					<li>Allow Rubber Tracks to make full length song stems available for download and remixing  (if you select this option, people using the stems will NOT be able to resell them). <em>This option allows for the greatest promotion of your music, as we would be able to promote the stems for remixing</em>.</li>
