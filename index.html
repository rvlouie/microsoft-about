            <p>Indaba is working with Microsoft to create a new sound library of independent music content for app developers to license music from. The initial pilot licensing library will include a limited number of applications (up to 50 total applications) and a limited number of Indaba songs (55 songs) with the objective of demonstrating success. </p>

    		<h1>Artist Summary</h1>
    		<ul>
          <li>Each artist will receive an upfront fee of $1,000 per song for use in the pilot program. During the pilot period, up to 50 applications will be able to sync the song into the app and embed the song as part of an in-app radio experience. </li>
          <li>The Indaba tracks in the library will be powered through the Xbox Music streaming service. As such, Indaba will distribute the pilot tracks to Xbox Music through compilations titled The Indaba Hotel, featuring the independent artists in the pilot program. All song revenue collected from Microsoft by Indaba from streams, downloads, or other revenue streams through this compilation will be passed along to participating artists. </li>
          <li>Based on the success of the pilot program, Indaba and Microsoft will expand the program to build a robust marketplace around licensing of music content for games and apps that would mutually benefit app developers and musicians. At this point there will be a business model established and an opportunity for more revenue generation</li>
          <li>In addition to the full track, artists will provide individual stems for use within the apps. Indaba will run contests for select songs to generate additional remixes of the songs, some of which will also be made available as part of the pilot programming.</li>

          <li><a href="#terms">Signed agreement</a> for licensing/distribution of the song and it’s elements (stems/artwork/etc.)</li>
          <li>Audio content, including mastered WAV/AIFF song file and individual song stems or session file.</li>
          <li>Visual content, including high-res artist promo images and album artwork.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> page for each artist, a requirement so that the pilot program can pull biography information and other relevant artist news for the service.  </li>

        <h1>Content Uses</h1>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Song Syncs</strong></li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the pilot program developers may use the licensed songs to sync into their apps/games (no more than 50 titles). The term of the sync would be for 7 years (standard game sync term). Developers will be encouraged, but not required, to give attribution to the artist.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> You’re playing Forza, the car racing, there is music synced to game play - for example, as you enter the final lap of the race the song changes to a specific intense track to mirror the intensity of the game play. This same song plays any time any user experience the same moment in game play.</p><p>Out of the max of 50 applications that will utilize this content, no more than 5 can be “music creation” applications. These songs are prohibited for use in professional music production applications like DAWs unless approved by Indaba.</p>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Listening Experience</strong></li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the pilot program, developers will be able to access the licensed songs through an API. The songs can’t be “sync’d” to the game/app to qualify for usage in this category.  Instead it is more of a listening experience that accompanies game play here. A requirement for using the content in this manner will be that the artist name and song name are listed in the application and that they link through to Xbox Music where the song is available for sale/stream.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> You’re playing Forza, the car racing game, and there’s a radio in your car that you can change the station to as you drive.</p>
          <li><strong>Stem Syncs</strong></li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the pilot program developers may use the licensed stems and song parts to sync into their apps/games. The term of the sync would be for 7 years (standard game sync term). Developers will be encouraged, but not required, to give attribution to the artist.</p><p>Out of the 50 applications that will utilize this content, no more than 5 can be “music creation” applications. These stems are prohibited for use in professional music production applications like DAWs unless approved by Indaba.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> You’re playing playing a game where as you walk around, the sonic landscape changes and different stems are mixed in and out of the experience.</p>

          <li>50/50 split of revenue collected by Indaba for each song once business model is established (after any potential remixer fees and Indaba administrative cost).   Also, during the trial period, 100% of revenue collected by Indaba for Xbox Music store sales is passed onto musician.</li>
          <li>Marketing and promotion value through API players that results in licensed music being streamed and purchased on Xbox Music (which Indaba will administer for free and pay you all revenue it collects).</li>
          <li>Promotion through syncs in apps and games</li>
          <li>Be part of an Indaba Music hosted remix contest: <ol><li>Prizing paid by Indaba</li><li>Promotion for your band</li><li>Winning content can be exploited by Indaba and artist</li><li>Winning content would feed back into the above uses 1-4</li></ol></li>
